        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> <span class="red-text"><em>Char kway teow</em> (Chinese: 炒粿條)</span> is a stir-fried rice noodle dish from Maritime Southeast Asia of southern Chinese origin.
            In Hokkien and Teochew, char means 'stir-fried' and kway teow refers to flat rice noodles. </p>

        <p> It is made from flat rice noodles (Chinese: 河粉) or kway teow (Chinese: 粿條) of approximately 1 cm or about 0.5 cm in width, 
            stir-fried over very high heat with garlic, light and dark soy sauce, chili paste, whole prawns, shelled blood cockles, 
            chopped Chinese chives, slices of Chinese sausage, and bean sprouts.</p>

        <p> An epic noodle dish from the streets of <b>Singapore and Malaysia</b> &mdash; 
            big flavours, contrasting textures and the signature hint of charred smokiness, this is bold Southeast Asian food at its best. </p>

            <li>5 cm / 2″ piece of fried fish cake</li>
            <li>20 stems garlic chives</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups bean sprouts</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>5 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 tsp light soy</li>
            <li>2 tsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>4 tsp kecap manis / sweet soy sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large non stick skillet over high heat.</li>
            <li>When heated, add shrimp and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until just cooked through, then remove into bowl</li>
            <li>Add Chinese sausage and fish cake, and cook for 1 minute until sausage is caramelised, then add to bowl.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp oil then add egg and cook, pushing in the edges to make a thick omelette. Once set, chop it up roughly using a wooden spoon, then add to bowl.</li>
            <li>Add bean sprouts and cook for about 1 minute until just starting to wilt, then add to bowl.</li>
            <li>Add lard. Once melted and starting to smoke, add garlic then immediately add noodles. Fold gently 4 times using a spatula + wooden spoon just to disperse oil through noodles.</li>
            <li>Tip all the other ingredients back in plus the chives. Fold gently twice, then pour all the Sauce over.</li>
            <li>Gently toss 4 to 6 times to disperse the sauce, pausing in between to allow the noodles to have a chance to caramelise on the edges a bit.</li>
            <li>Remove from stove and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>

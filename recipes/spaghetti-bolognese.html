        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> <b>Spaghetti bolognese</b>, often shortened to "spag bol" in the UK and Australia, 
            is a popular pasta dish outside Italy consisting of spaghetti and bolognese sauce.  </p>

        <p> Bolognese sauce (Italian: Ragù alla bolognese) is a slowly cooked meat-based sauce, and its preparation 
            involves several techniques, including sweating, sautéing, and braising. 
            Ingredients include a characteristic soffritto of onion, celery, and carrot, and different types of minced 
            or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork. </p>

        <p> Everyone needs a basic spaghetti bolognese recipe that still tastes great, no matter how simple. 
            Get that depth of flavour by cooking the sauce very gently until it&apos;s super rich. 
            This spag bol is designed to be a low cost recipe.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingedients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>400g/14oz beef mince</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>100g/3½oz carrot, grated</li>
            <li>2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>400ml/14fl oz stock (made from stock cube. Ideally beef, but any will do)</li>
            <li>400g/14oz dried spaghetti</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and once hot add the beef mince and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the mince until well browned over a medium-high heat (be careful not to burn the mince. It just needs to be a dark brown colour). Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the mince in and turn the heat to medium. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then pour the mince and any juices in the bowl back into the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature to simmer gently for 45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt. Cook according to the packet instructions. Once the spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese sauce. Mix well and serve.</li>
        </ol>
